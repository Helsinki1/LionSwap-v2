# LionSwap

## Installation

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Dependencies (Next.js App)
```bash
cd next-app
npm install
```

**Note**: The project uses `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to resolve compatibility issues between React 19 and some dependencies. This is already configured, so a regular `npm install` should work without issues.

## Dependencies
